                    John Berger, in full John Peter Berger, (born November 5, 1926, London, England—died January 2, 2017, Antony, France), 
                    British essayist and cultural thinker as well as a prolific novelist, poet, translator, and screenwriter. He is best 
                    known for his novel G. and his book and BBC series Ways of Seeing.

                <p>
                	John Berger was one of the most influential thinkers and writers of postwar Europe. As a novelist, he won the Booker 
                    prize in 1972, donating half his prize money to the Black Panthers. As a TV presenter, he changed the way we looked 
                    at art with Ways of Seeing. As a storyteller and political activist, he defended the rights and dignity of workers, 
                    migrants, and the oppressed around the world. “Far from dragging politics into art,” he wrote in 1953, “art has dragged 
                    me into politics.” He remained a revolutionary up to his death in January 2017.
