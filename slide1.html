      <h1>Welcome to RMB City!</h1>
      <img src="../assets/lz.png" alt="Intro to RMB Ctiy" style="height: 400px;">
      <p>A city dubbed RMB City is being built in Second Life by China Tracy. Itâ€™s a city that is a condensed incarnation of contemporary Chinese cities with most of their characteristics; a series of new Chinese fantasy realms that are highly self-contradictory, inter-permeative, pan-political, extremely entertaining, and laden with irony and suspicion. The publication of RMB City draws the whole picture of this unique project, and explores the uncertain reality within Second Life together with various authors from art, architecture, literature, music and media fields. </p>
