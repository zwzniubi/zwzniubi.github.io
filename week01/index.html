        <p>Based on the article that I read from Emann Odufu, I understand and learned that digital sculpture has done a major impact towards the world. The conservation between Emann and Auriea helps me to understand how digital sculpture had not just impact the history, but as well as engineering such as the use of 3D printing. With the help of sculpture people can now hold something in their hand that was once in a computer. It can turn impossible to possible. </p>
