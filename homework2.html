<p>In the article "As We Think," the quote inspried me: “Consider a future device …  in which an individual stores all his books, records, 
       and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged 
       intimate supplement to his memory.” It was a quote by Vanner Bush, a very famous scientistHe is known particularly for his engineering 
       work on analog computers, and for the memex. He talks about the revolution of enginerring from something that no one wants to something
       that every country fighting in the modern day.
